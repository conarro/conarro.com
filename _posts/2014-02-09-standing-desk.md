There are [plenty](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/17/get-up-get-out-dont-sit/) [of](http://healthland.time.com/2012/03/28/standing-up-on-the-job-one-way-to-improve-your-health/) [articles](http://www.mayoclinic.org/sitting/expert-answers/faq-20058005) discussing the health implications of sitting down for long periods of time. I've been experiencing some minor lower back pain as of late, so I decided to explore the possibility of using a [standing desk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_desk) while I work. In order to save money, I avoided the [more sophisticated desk options](http://www.nextdesks.com/terra) and opted to put one together myself.

As with most DIY projects, I started by heading over to ~~Bing~~ [Google](http://www.google.com/?#q=diy+standing+desk) and seeing what ideas were already out there. A few clicks in, I came across [Colin Nederkoorn's solution](http://iamnotaprogrammer.com/Ikea-Standing-desk-for-22-dollars.html). To build his standing desk, Colin elected to build a monitor and keyboard platform and stack it on his existing desk. Since this approach was extremely cheap and easy, I figured I'd give it a shot.

## Supplies

As Colin's blog points out, the only supplies necessary are some screws and a few cheap IKEA pieces.

__IKEA stuff:__

* [LACK side table](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/40104270/#/20011408) - $7.99
* [EKBY VALTER bracket](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/56696109/#/80167473) (x2) - $8
* [EKBY VICTOR shelf](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/20167961/) - $5.99

__Other stuff:__

* Drill / screwdriver
* 1" wood screws (x4)
* 1 3/4" wood screws (x4)

## Directions

1. Assemble the side table
2. Using the 1" screws, attach the shelf brackets to the front legs of the table
3. Using the 1 3/4" screws, attach the shelf to the top of the brackets
4. Place the table on your desk and move all your stuff
5. Stand up!

## Results

Here are a few shots of my new setup:

The jury is still out on whether or not standing up will ease my back pain, but if you're in the market for an inexpensive standing desk, I would definitely recommend this solution.

_Note: 20-minute setup time does not include the hours spent wandering through IKEA trying to find the three small items needed for this project_
