This week I attended the first-ever [Great Wide Open Conference (GWO)](http://greatwideopen.org) in Atlanta. The conference, which focuses on open source software, featured a lot of great speakers from top tech companies around the country. After two days chock-full of content, here are a few of the highlights:

*  _Sustainable Government_ opening keynote by [Clay Johnson](https://twitter.com/cjoh), CEO at DOBT.co. Clay talked about how closed government hurts us, and how developers + open data can scale democracy.
* _NoSQL Databases in the Cloud_ by [Ines Sombra](https://twitter.com/randommood), Lead Data Engineer at Engine Yard. Ines gave a high-energy rundown of MongoDB and Riak and the pros and cons of each ([talk on Github](https://github.com/Randommood/GreatWideOpen2014)).
* _Intro to Chef_ by [Nathen Harvey](https://twitter.com/nathenharvey), Technical Community Manager at Chef. Nathen talked about the need for configuration management tools and gave [an overview of how Chef Server works](https://speakerdeck.com/nathenharvey/introduction-to-chef-1).
* _Overview of Firefox OS_ by [Jason Weathersby](https://twitter.com/JASONWEATHERSBY), Technical Evangelist at Mozilla. Jason demoed the developer tools for Firefox OS, an impressive, web-inspired mobile operating system from Mozilla.

As developers, it's easy (and important) to focus on the backlog and pound away at our keyboards. That said, attending a conference is a good excuse to step out of the hustle-and-bustle, rub shoulders with fellow developers, and think about tools and technologies from a different perspective. It was great to see so many people come out and support open source (700+ registrants), and I hope to see the GWO come back again next year!
